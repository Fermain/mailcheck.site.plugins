                            Been using Mailcheck for about 6 months now. Tried
                            other services before but decided to stay with
                            Mailcheck as these guys are truly doing what they
                            offer. I had a years old email list but after
                            running it through a verification never thought that
                            20% of it would come back as invalid! No wonder why
                            my sender score was so bad! Also, as an online-store
                            owner, I really enjoyed the benefits of their API
                            feature. And the cost..Absolutely worth it!

                            Name of the brand popped my attention, I decided to
                            try because was planning to launch my marketing
                            campaign, some leads were outdated, didn't want to
                            blacklist my email account status and my domain, so
                            went to Mailcheck. I can say honestly these guys
                            kicking their A***s off to make sure their users
                            receive what they paid for. Highly recommend!!!
