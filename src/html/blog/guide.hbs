      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Email verification service is provided to ensure your letters reach inboxes of
        real customers. It helps you to increase the outcome from your email marketing campaigns as you get updated data
        on the actuality of your mailing list. Below you can find out all you need to know about email address
        verification.</p>

      <h3 class="text-thin subtitle">Grounding to Email Address Verification</h3>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">If you make sales with email marketing then getting actual information about the
        validity of your client’s email addresses is very important for your business. Of course, mostly on the moment
        of subscription to your newsletter or registration in your service, you have the valid email which belongs to
        your client. However, it is figured out that 22% of emails get deleted or abandoned yearly. Thus, without email
        verification service you cannot really define the efficiency of your email marketing campaign.</p>
      <img class="article-image" src="../../assets/img/guide-img1.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="Guide to Email Verification Service">
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Why? The thing is that you get corrupted data on deliverability, conversion rate,
        and other metrics. Moreover, when bounce rate decreases you are at risk of getting sanctions from mailing
        service which may lead to the inability of your letter to get to the user’s inbox in future. Read how to
        increase deliverability of your mails. On the other hand, using email address verification service can let you
        avoid all of these problems.</p>
      <h3 class="text-thin subtitle">Disclosing Email Verification Process</h3>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Email address verification consists of three stages:</p>
      <ul class="text-thin terms-text">
        <li>email formatting and syntax check</li>
        <li>domain confirmation</li>
        <li>mailbox validation</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">It all takes seconds for the service to accomplish each stage, however,
        verification can take even several hours if you have a big mailing list. Below we will tell you more about each
        of the stages taken.</p>
      <h3 class="text-thin subtitle">Email Formatting and Syntax Check</h3>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Some of the major email service providers have special requirements to the email
        addresses. For example, Yahoo email address should start with a character, not a number. Moreover, sometimes
        there can be mistakes in your mailing list (for example, an absence of the @ in the email address).</p>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Thus in order, to make sure all of the emails in your base correspond to the
        approved syntax and formatting verification service provides a check. This is a zero level action which has to
        be done first.</p>
      <h3 class="text-thin subtitle">Domain Confirmation</h3>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">After the first step is completed it is time to check the validity of the DNS
        records for the specified domain name. Email verification service checks whether the mail exchange is able to
        accept letters.</p>
      <h3 class="text-thin subtitle">Mailbox Validation</h3>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">The last step of email address verification considers enforcement of SMTP protocol
        in order to validate the mailbox and make sure it exists and able to receive letters. The best services make it
        even without sending test letters.</p>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">It can take more time to complete all of the three stages if the email address
        belongs to the outdated mailing service or if there are busy servers.</p>
