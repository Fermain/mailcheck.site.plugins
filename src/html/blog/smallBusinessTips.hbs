      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Although it sounds obvious, there are many companies that still do not have a
        subscription form on a website. Another mistake you can often see on the company website is a subscription form
        with too many fields to fill. People need quick and easy subscription in the right place. It should take minimum

          sufficient increase in subscriptions. If you really need more info about the user still do not make too many
          fields in the subscription form - you can get all the info you need from the user later after he estimates the
          value of your company.
