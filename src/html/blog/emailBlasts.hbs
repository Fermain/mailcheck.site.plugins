      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Ever wondered what an email blast is? Well, someone may call it an email campaign,
        which it is to a certain degree. An email blast, in its essence, is an unpersonalized email sent to a
        large number of subscribers. An email blast is used to target all your subscribers at once with the
        ultimate goal to draw traffic to your site or increase sales. The recipients of an email blast are
        not typically targeted in a strategic manner.</p>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text">An email blast is probably no longer the best email marketing practice, as many email
        marketers would say, and often such emails end up in your subscriber’s spam folder. The
        ultimate purpose is to create a single message that would be useful to every subscriber in your
        email list. Now think about nearly 4 billion email users around the world and the different
        tastes, desires, and goals they have. That being said, sending out one single email to all the
        contacts in your email list indiscriminately will most likely not bring the desired results.
        Moreover, it can potentially harm your business in the following ways:</p>

			<ol class="text-thin terms-text numbered-list">
				<li>Your unsubscribe rate will increase dramatically (which is not something you expect your
          email campaign to bring you).</li>
				<li>Having a significant bounce rate will compromise the credibility of your email marketing
          campaign in particular and your business overall.</li>
			</ol>

        <p class="text-thin text-thin-small  article-image-description">Source: Digital Savvy</p>
      </div>

			<p class="text-thin terms-text">So what must one do in order to avoid the above consequences and have their email blast
        work out for the best? We have assembled four essential steps to help your email blast, or email
        campaign, get delivered, and bring some meaningful results.</p>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text">The number one task to tackle is to <strong>sort through your email database.</strong> Whether you
        want it or not, some emails are fake and have no real readers behind them. However, there
        certainly is a way to eliminate those in your email database. So before launching an email
        marketing campaign and sending out email blasts, you need to screen through your email
        database first in order to keep your bounce rate at zero. For this purpose, we have
        created <a class="text-thin text-thin-link" href="https://www.mailcheck.co/#features">Mailcheck</a>
        - a state-of-the-art email validation tool, that employs refined algorithms to
        validate the authenticity of the email addresses in your database. One of the Mailcheck
        distinctive features is that aside from automatic search and validation, it also conducts manual
        moderation. Keep in mind, that the larger your list grows, the more important it is to rely on
        dependable and fast email validation service. Therefore, with the algorithms refined by time and
        experience, it now takes us only 15 minutes to validate one million email addresses.</p>

      <ol class="text-thin terms-text numbered-list">Validating your email database must be the first and foremost task to do, because:
        <li>You don’t want any fake emails to constitute your future email lists and further on add
          an extra step into your marketing routine.</li>
        <li>You want to eliminate this step from the outset of your email marketing campaign, once
          and forever.</li>
      </ol>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Next step - <strong>create (a.k.a. clean up) your email list.</strong> Email list cleaning is all about
        removing inactive and inaccurate emails from your list. This also involves removing
        your unsubscribers. This may sound like an extra step, which can be put aside until better times.
        However, if not handled properly and on time, it can cause you troubles, such as being banned
        by Gmail from sending out emails to its users.</p>

      <div class="article-image-container">

        <p class="text-thin text-thin-small article-image-description">Source: NicePNG</p>
      </div>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Next and equally important step - <strong>segment your email list.</strong> An email blast at its core is
        designed to target a large number of people, and personalizing it wouldn’t be much possible if at
        all. However, segmenting your email list can provide a similar effect. Email segmentation is
        dividing the subscribers in your email list by age, gender, region, interests, purchase history, etc.
        For instance, a pet store won’t be sending its cat owners an email about dog carriers sale.
			</p>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Last but not least - <strong>your email must include a clear call to action.</strong> It is important
        to understand that having your subscribers open your email doesn’t mean the job is done. It is
        just a drop in the bucket on the way to accomplishing the final goal. Having a clear
        understanding of what you want your subscribers to ultimately do will shape the call-to-action
        you will put in your email. You can find out more about how to write a compelling call-to-action
        email <a class="text-thin text-thin-link" href="https://www.mailcheck.co/six-tips-to-write-an-email-that-prompts-your-subscribers-to-action">here</a>.
			</p>

			<p class="text-thin terms-text">One last and already mentioned thing, an email blast is probably no longer the best email
        marketing practice, and the reason to that rests primarily in the term “blast” itself (there are
        multiple debates why “blast” is not the best term for an email campaign). Our advice - rethink
        the idea of an email blast at its core. In the end, you’re not <span class="text-italic">blasting</span> your recipients; you
        are <span class="text-italic">providing</span> them with valuable content that may persuade them to pay for your service or
        product.
