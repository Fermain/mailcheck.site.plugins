      <p class="text-thin terms-text">In the previous article, we discussed what email API is, reviewed the email API
          mechanism, analyzed a couple of examples of email API application as well as discussed the benefits of using
          email API. Click <a class="text-thin text-thin-link" href="/what-is-email-API-and-why-do-I-need-one">here</a>
          to find out more. </p>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text">We have established that having an email API integrated into your website or app
          provides automation of many processes such as generating password reset emails, notification emails, and
          sending mass marketing campaigns through third-party platforms. Email API is also extensively used in sending
          automatic email notifications such as those related to social media use (likes, comments, follow
          requests, etc.). Email API has multiple use, however, one and probably most important feature is that an
          integrated email API ensures a clean email database. Lots of businesses may, however, underestimate the
          potential of email API. A long-established business knows that having an email API saves a lot of such
          precious time and ensures smoothly run email campaigns.</p>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text">According to Mailchimp, an average email open rate is 21.33%. This means that out
          of all emails you may have in your database, only 21% on average opens emails your business sends to them.
          Sounds like a lot of work for such a small return? The good news is that email validation API can ease it off
          a little by taking care of a part of your headache. Email validation API will ensure that your email database
          consists of only real emails and that your emails will be sent to real leads only, thus increasing your open
          and click-through rates. Email validation API essentially validates emails by screening your email database
          and filtering out all fake, invalid, “catch-all” emails, keeping your email list clean, and consisting of
          prospective clients only.</p>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text">These days, the internet is flooded with online shops, all of them are direct
          and indirect competitors to you. You might have a super-duper product to sell that will solve all your
          customer’s problems and bring them joy. But this is only a drop in the ocean out of all that you must put
          into your business. The behind-the-scenes things like marketing strategies, brand awareness, a smooth-running
          website, reliable payment gateway, and many more must constitute the majority in your business plan.</p>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Have you ever tried to buy something online, went through most of the checkout
          steps, and then abandoned it because you found the checkout to be too tedious? If you ever found yourself
          in a similar situation, your customers have too. Easy and smooth checkout, easy signup, and order placing
          process as well as many other aspects are a part of pleasant user experience, and email validation API has a
          part to play in it.</p>

      <div class="article-image-container">
        <img class="article-image" src="../../assets/img/email-dashboard.png" alt="email dashboard">
        <p class="text-thin text-thin-small  article-image-description">Source: weDevs</p>
      </div>


      <p class="text-thin terms-text">First and foremost, email validation will save you and your customers a lot of
          time. You probably came across websites that would tell you if you entered a wrong email address when you
          tried to sign up. This is where email API is employed. Now, imagine your website has no such feature. Your
          customer makes a mistake in his/her email address or a shipping address without noticing it, places an order,
          and the entire order tracking process goes downhill, resulting in your customer not getting his/her order and
          you having to spend time on figuring this out. Sounds like a loss, doesn’t it? An integrated email API will
          detect such mistakes at the point of placing the order or sign up and will make sure your customers enter only
          valid details before your system accepts the order and initiates shipping. You will also save costs of
          re-assigning jobs for staff, wasted postage, and other resources.</p>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Another huge advantage of real-time email verification is that you can also catch
          user typos from the point of signing up and prompt the user to fix them before completing the registration.
          This ensures that only real email addresses get registered and increases the number of potential customers.</p>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Email validation API is a completely automated process and doesn’t require any
          manual handling. It is an integrated feature your customers may not even guess about. However, it creates an
          overall positive experience when your customers are interacting with your website. If customers have good
          shopping experience, not only they will come back, they will also spread the word about you. These are small
          elements of any business that clump up to improve your brand loyalty and nurture the customer relationship,
          which in turn increases sales.</p>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text">You could potentially manage your business without an email validation API.
          However, using email validation API not only shows that you care about your customer, but it is also an
          indicator that you keep up with the latest technologies and are contemporary with the way you run your business.</p>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text">There’s a number of email validation providers, but
          <a class="text-thin text-thin-link" href="/#features">Mailcheck</a> is the one that surely stands out.
          Email verification API from Mailcheck will provide you real-time email address verification by integrating
          the API directly with your application, websites, or sign-up forms so that each time a user registers,
          their emails are automatically verified and validated. One of the remarkable features is that aside from
          doing a bulk email validation, you can install <a class="text-thin text-thin-link" href="/#contact-us">Mailcheck</a>
          API on your website and check email addresses at the point of registration - something that your customers
          will notice and approve.</p>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text">While email validation API may seem like a minor thing, it will substantially ease
          your job and will allow you to spend your time on other more important tasks.</p>
