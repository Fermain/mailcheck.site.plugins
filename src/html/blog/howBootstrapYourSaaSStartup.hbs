      <p class="text-thin terms-text">In the previous article, we discussed what email API is, reviewed the email API
          mechanism, analyzed a couple of examples of email API application as well as discussed the benefits of using
          email API. Click <a class="text-thin text-thin-link" href="/howBootstrapYourSaaSStartup">here</a>
          to find out more. </p>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Every project starts with an idea, and every idea eventually converts into a plan which, if
        executed properly, leads to successful project implementation. In a software product
        development, an idea constitutes just a minor part and the success of your product launch is
        allocated to other no less important things such as a well-executed business plan, properly
        conducted market research, meticulously selected development team, and the budget available to
        launch the product. In the article below we will have a closer look at what exactly constitutes a
        successful SaaS product launch.</p>

      </div>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text"><strong>Analyze your idea</strong>
        When you are in the early stages of developing your future SaaS product the first question you
        must ask yourself is “What is the problem I need to solve and how will my product solve it?”
        Think of any problems you can address by creating a product that can solve it, or study the
        current software products offered on the market, see what solutions they offer, and think how you
        can make your product better. If there is a problem you have experienced yourself and you know
        there are other people who experienced it too - that’s even better. The research to conduct will be
        minor and you can jump straight away into creating a solution to this problem. Remember, if
        your product doesn’t solve a problem, it is useless. As Russell L. Ackoff noted, “We fail more
        often because we solve the wrong problem than because we get the wrong solution to the right
        problem.”</p>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text"><strong>HCreate a lean business plan</strong>
        As outdated as it may sound, business plans are necessary, and they do work. No need to go nuts
        and create a 50 pages business plan. A simple one-page outline of your strategy will do. You can
        always go back to it if you need to make adjustments and it will be much easier to change a
        simple plan rather than changing an already thought-through business plan. You can create a
        bullet-point plan or break it down in a table format, or you can use a business planning software
        like Enloop to help you with building your lean business plan.</p>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text"><strong>Determine your strategy</strong>
        This is where you define your unique value proposition (UVP). Your UVP is what separates your
        business from your competitors. It also explains how your product solves your customers’
        problem, what benefits it brings, and why your target customers should choose you over the
        competition. This is also where you define your target market and analyze your competition.</p>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text"><strong>Define how you will market your SaaS product</strong>
        Marketing something that has no physical presence, like a SaaS product, has its own set of rules.
        It takes a person a couple of days or even hours to consider and purchase a SaaS product (be it a
        project management tool or a CRM software subscription). So the efforts needed to market a
        SaaS product are quite manageable compared to marketing a new car make. Tactics to consider
        first and foremost:
        • Offer a free trial of your product
        • Share data-driven content (case studies, statistics)
        • Demonstrate your social proof by posting reviews and testimonials about your product
        • Offer attractive deals
        • Reward customers for referrals
        • Employ content marketing and SEO to attract more customers

        For SEO, you can use Google Analytics or any other free SEO tools, like CanIRank or Seobility.
        However, note that most of the other data tools simply piggyback on Google’s data.</p>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text"><strong>Select the right development team</strong>
        While the SaaS product development steps discussed above involve a lot of thinking and
        analyzes, the design and development of the actual product or at least its prototype is the task
        that requires the application of hand and brain labor.
        It is not necessary for you as the CEO of your business to also be a CTO of your product.
        Outsourcing the technical part of the product development is what most SaaS startups would
        resort to these days, and so can you. The question then is “Where to get a good development
        team to bring my idea into life?”</p>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text">A typical development team usually consists of a project manager, business analyst, front-end
        and back-end developers, UX/UI designer, and a QA engineer. The benefits of hiring a dedicated
        development team over an in-house team are huge:
        • Hiring a dedicated development team can be scaled according to your needs and
        requirements. Depending on the task, you can select the number of experts and their
        seniority levels.
        • An outsourced development team usually has extensive experience working with
        complicated projects. They are focused solely on your project and are set on reaching
        your goals with no distractions.
        • When hiring a dedicated development team you don't need to worry about adding extra
        workspace in your office. All the recruitment and administration hassle is diminished too.
        This is much simpler and cheaper than hiring an in-house specialist.
        • You can assume direct control over the management of your dedicated development team
        within the project they work on.
        • When you are hiring a team you are hiring an already solid group of people who have
        previously worked on other projects together, so you are eliminating the need for team
        building.</p>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Yes, it may cost you a penny to hire a remote dedicated development team, but again, this is
        something you shouldn’t try to save on as this is where your future product is born. Be sure that
        the benefits you will receive from hiring a dedicated development team will surely pay off in the
        long run.
        You may consider hiring a remote development team even more in the times of COVID.
        Companies look to hire experienced and affordable experts remotely, and they find them … in
        Ukraine. For the last decade, this European country has grown into a true tech hub for many US
        companies, for reasons such as an abundance of skillful software developers, affordable pay
        rates, and convenient time zone. Many software development companies in Ukraine develop and
        sell their own software products as well as outsource their development teams to help other
        startups grow. A decent example of such a company is Mailcheck - a team of dedicated software
        developers who aside from building their own successful email validation platform, specializes
        in developing products for iGaming and eCommerce industries. Mailcheck offers a team of
        experienced developers, project managers, business analysts, and designers that have a decent
        portfolio of successfully launched products. If you have an idea for a software product and
        looking for an experienced development team to do all the hands-on work shoot them an email at
          <a class="text-thin text-thin-link" href="//partnership@mailcheck.co">partnership@mailcheck.co.</a></p>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text">As you can see, developing a SaaS startup has its own specifics and rules which, if followed
        correctly, will guarantee a successful product launch and its further operation. If you are
        currently working on developing a software product we hope that this article will serve you as a
        guide.</p>
