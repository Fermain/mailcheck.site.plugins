      <h2 class="title">The Right Approach to Email Address Validation</h2>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Email address validation has been the matter of concern for webmasters, email
        marketers and online services for years. There are many companies offering email validation services developing
        various tools and approaches to provide advanced solutions for this problem. Since this problem and the ways to
        solve it exist for years we finally can make a right approach to email address verfification once and for
        all.</p>
      <h3 class="text-thin subtitle">What Is Email Address Validation?</h3>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">First, let us start with the definition of word ‘valid’ concerning the email
        address. We should also make a correction considering that we use email addresses to make mailings for our
        purposes to derive the definition of this word like we need. Thus, we call email address valid if it complies
        the following requirements:</p>
      <ul class="text-thin terms-text">
        <li>Email address belongs to the user that has subscribed to our newsletter</li>
        <li>Email address is still used by the user that has subscribed to our newsletter</li>
        <li>The owner of the email address wants to/doesn’t mind to receive our letters</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="text-thin subtitle">Email Address Belongs to The User That Has Subscribed to Our Newsletter</h3>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">In case user entered a wrong address that doesn’t exist we get a hard bounce. In
        case user enters a wrong address that belongs to another user we can get a soft bounce or that user can put our
        mail to the spam box which is definitely going to have negative effect on our sender reputation. Thus, it is
        vital to be sure that the email address belongs to the right user.</p>
      <h4 class="text-thin subtitle">How to Comply This Requirement?</h4>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">There are several things you can do to comply this requirement:</p>
      <ul class="text-thin terms-text">
        <li>Send confirmation letters - if for authorization in your service or subscribing the newsletter a user has to
          follow the activation link inside the letter you send him for confirmation, there is no chance that the email
          address he has entered is wrong in any way, as he cannot confirm the subscription if the email entered is
          wrong
        </li>
        <li>Do not buy email lists - you do not know the method that was used to collect it</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 class="text-thin subtitle">Disclaimer to The Requirement</h4>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text"> You only can be assured that email belongs to the user at the moment of its
        confirmation. You do not know what the user will make afterwards - transfer it to someone another, delete or
        abandoned. That is why you need to comply the following requirement.</p>

      <h3 class="text-thin subtitle">Email Address Is Still Used by The User That Has Subscribed to Our Newsletter</h3>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Even in case the email address is valid know it can get invalid in future just
        because the user has deleted, abandoned or transferred a valid email address to another person. Such a thing
        doesn’t depend on you, so all you can do is to follow the recommendations below.</p>
      <h4 class="text-thin subtitle">How to Comply This Requirement?</h4>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">First of all, the best way to make user motivated to get your newsletter is to
        make it valuable for him. However, this is not a matter under discussion now. Let’s review the technical
        moments:</p>
      <ul class="text-thin terms-text">
        <li>If you get several soft bounces in a row during a month there is something wrong with this email address. Of
          course, the reason can be in temporary errors on the server or absence of space in the user’s inbox. If the
          opening rate for this user is 0 or very low, still, you better delete him from the list.
        </li>
        <li>If you get one hard bounce from the email address check the content of the letter. Maybe it contains
          unacceptable
          by the ESP content or formatting. However, in such a case you will get a prompt failed delivery messages from
          other addresses as well. So if you get only one, delete the address from the list.
        </li>
        <li>If the opening rate from the user remains at 0 level for months you better delete him from the list.</li>
        <li>Make it easy for the user to change an email address as he can move to another mailbox still unwilling to
          give up
          on your newsletter.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 class="text-thin subtitle">Disclaimer to The Requirement</h4>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">All these tips are based on practice, they are not ideal as there can be many
        scenarios. However, the majority of successful email marketers use these tips for their good.</p>

      <h3 class="text-thin subtitle">The owner of the email address wants to/doesn’t mind to receive our letters</h3>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">On the moment of subscription confirmation you can say that user really doesn’t
        mind getting letters from you. However, the time passes and it can be hard to predict how his attitude will
        change. For the email marketer it is essential to make sure the user is fond of getting letters from you now so
        that email marketing campaign show good results.</p>
