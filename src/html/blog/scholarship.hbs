        receive new applications.</p>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Beginning May 01, 2019, we are announcing a scholarship program for 2019 year. We
        will choose three lucky winners to receive $1,500 to cover expenses for studying or just self-development. We
        are totally confident that your talents and eagerness to make this world better must be appreciated. Thus, we
        have created this beneficial program exactly for students who are eager to open new horizons.</p>

                                                          href="https://www.mailcheck.co">new era of email
        verification</a>. We are a team that validates emails and phones using social networks for the past 3 years. Our
        team consists of impressively skilled
        engineers and experienced software developers who are able to work with numerous algorithms. Our service will be
        useful to those who are working every day to increase conversion in email mailings and who can not overcome the
        bounce system of mail servers. We will also be useful to those who want to know who is behind that email or
        phone in order to save time.</p>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">
        Certainly, love for what we do has made it possible to create such a diverse range of email verification
        services. The most requested ones are an <a class="text-thin text-thin-link"
                                                    href="https://www.mailcheck.co/#pricing">agency subscription</a>
        which includes 5000 emails, with an average charge of $0.004 per email.</p>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">As the number of emails increase, price per email can go down, for example, <a
          class="text-thin text-thin-link"
          href="https://www.mailcheck.co/#pricing">“Enterprise” subscription.</a></p>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">The main difference from our competitors is that we do not use an automatic search
        and validation only, but also a manual moderation filtered materials. So we use all the power of social networks
        and search engines, for more in-depth validation.</p>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Mailcheck - 2.47% - This is the percentage of bounce sent cold-based email
        addresses after our validation.</p>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">In order to maintain a passion for email validation, self-development, and
        professional growth in the new generation, we are offering a scholarship.</p>
