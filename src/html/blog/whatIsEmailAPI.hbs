      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Businesses of all sizes use email as a primary way of communicating with their customers. Tens
        of billions of emails are sent every day - a continuous conversation between businesses and their
        customers around the world.</p>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text">However, sending such a gigantic amount of emails manually is time-consuming and inevitably
        fallible. Sending emails to tens or even hundreds of thousands of people is nearly impossible
        without having a developer taking care of it. While it is possible to write software to automate
        your emails from scratch, this will further require continuous maintenance and upkeep.</p>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Email APIs are the most efficient way to send and manage email notifications as well as
        transactional email messages.</p>

      <h2 class="text-thin subtitle subtitle-left">What is an email API?</h2>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text">An email API allows applications to access functions offered by the email service providers’
        platforms, such as Gmail, Outlook, etc., including generating and sending transactional emails,
        manipulating templates, moving or editing folders, building drafts, and more. Besides, APIs
        allow powerful analytics of this data - something you wouldn’t get if integrating with email
        service providers directly. Email API providers handle protocol matters such as message
        assembly, message sending, and reporting that would otherwise need to be managed by the
        application software development team.</p>

      <div class="article-image-container">
        <img class="article-image" src="../../assets/img/vero.jpg" alt="Vero">
        <p class="text-thin text-thin-small  article-image-description">Source: Vero</p>
      </div>

			<p class="text-thin terms-text">There are two categories of email APIs: transactional and contextual.</p>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Transactional email APIs are for sending bulk or routine emails, such as password reset,
        notification emails, and mass marketing campaigns through third-party platforms. The role of
        an email API is that it lets you design beautiful transactional emails and integrate them directly
        into the functionality of your website or app so you can get the full potential of a well-designed
        email instead of just including the bare minimum of essential information for customers.</p>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Contextual email APIs are designed for developers building software applications that require
        email sync, send, and analytics embedded directly into the application for their end-user's
        benefit. Productivity tools, CRMs, applicant tracking systems, and even car consoles use email
        APIs to embed email functionality into the application. Contextual emails allow you to sync,
        send, receive, and collect analytics, as well as take care of general
        <a class="text-thin text-thin-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a>
        for each email service
        provider connection.
       </p>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Email APIs are also extensively used in sending notifications. Many software tools and websites
        use notifications to inform their users when something happens with their account or on the
        platform. For example, Facebook and Instagram notify their users of a new like or a comment
        made in response to a user’s post. It doesn’t always make sense to send an email for each action
        that occurs in an application. However, if this action requires the user’s attention, sending an
        email is the best way to ensure that the user sees the information on time.</p>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Here’s an example of an automated email sent by
        <a class="text-thin text-thin-link" href="https://www.booking.com/">booking.com</a>
        using an email marketing API to thank the customer for leaving a review of their recent hotel stay.
      </p>

        <p class="text-thin text-thin-small article-image-description">Source: Author’s own</p>
      </div>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Clearly, using an email API having five customers on your list would make no sense. But when
        you have a whole database of customers, email API is almost inevitable.
			</p>

      <h2 class="text-thin subtitle subtitle-left">The mechanism behind email APIs</h2>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text">This is what generating or sending a notification or transactional email with an email API would
        look like:
      </p>

      <ul class="text-thin terms-text">
        <li>A user makes an online purchase or sends a password reset request through a web-based
          service or a mobile app.</li>
        <li>The service or app communicates with an API on the cloud email delivery service and
          provides such information as the customer email address, the details of the purchase or
          password reset, and other details.</li>
        <li>The email service generates a message with those details, using a template that has
          already been established for that specific purpose. (Depending on customer's request,
          your purchase email will probably look and read differently from a password reset email).</li>
        <li>The email service transmits the message, taking into account various technical processes
          required to ensure the email is delivered into the customer’s inbox.</li>
        <li>The email service records specific details about the delivery of the message, such as
          whether it was delivered or failed and why, if it was opened, if the recipient clicked any of
          the links in the email, etc. Those details are available on a dashboard.</li>
      </ul>

			<p class="text-thin terms-text">With integrated email API applications do not need to transmit fully constructed email
        messages with header information. They can simply send key:value pairs related directly to the
        content of the message: subject, body, recipients.
			</p>

      <div class="text-with-image">
        <p class="text-thin terms-text">In addition to the above, email API is widely used in email validation processes. Acting as a
          filter between your platform, website or app and your existing or potential customers, it
          screens out any bots that could get into your
          <a class="text-thin text-thin-link" href="https://www.mailcheck.co/does-buying-email-lists-still-work">email list</a>
          and possibly damage your business in the long run if not filtered out on time. There’s thousands of email API providers to
          choose from. However, a feature that singles out
          <a class="text-thin text-thin-link" href="https://www.mailcheck.co/#features">Mailcheck</a>,
          an email validation service, is that it has a built in API integration feature that allows validating your email database on
          the go. When someone attempts to create an account on your website/platform using a fake
          email,
          <a class="text-thin text-thin-link" href="https://www.mailcheck.co/#pricing">Mailcheck</a>
          built-in API integration will ban such email from getting into your database, therefore keeping your email list clean and only consisting of real potential customers.

      <h2 class="text-thin subtitle subtitle-left">Benefits of using email API</h2>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text">One of the primary purposes of an email API is to act as an intermediary level between your web
        service or app and your customers. It assists in tracking metrics such as how many messages
        were successfully delivered, how many messages were rejected by an internet service provider,
        reasons for messages not being delivered, how many recipients opened a message, or how many
        links were clicked. So email API plays an important role in providing a meaningful assessment
        of your email campaigns.
      </p>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Deliverability is the end goal of every email campaign and it is dependent on many technical
        factors and contingencies. Email APIs handle this task flawlessly. Email API providers are
        responsible for minimizing any interruptions caused by Internet outages, natural disasters,
        distributed denial of service attacks, and a variety of other network problems that could impact
        the delivery of your emails. Their service guarantees that you won’t lose any business because
        your servers were unable to respond or poorly configured.
      </p>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text">You <span class="text-italic">could</span> potentially manage without an email API…if it was the 90s. In the era of constantly
        changing technologies, economic demand, and consumer behavior, integrating email APIs into
        your existing platforms is all but necessary to make your customer communications faster and
          <a class="text-thin text-thin-link" href="https://www.process.st/workflow-software">more efficient</a> and to save yourself that always lacking time.
