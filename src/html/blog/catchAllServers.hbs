      <h1 class="title">What Do You Need to Know About Catch-All Email Servers?</h1>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">In this article we are going to explain catch-all email servers, why do they
        exist, why it is a problem for you and how you can find them in your mailing list and build a proper email
        strategy.</p>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">The catch-all email server is a widely used tool that allows an owner to receive
        all the emails sent to the domain. For example, if your email server domain is @example.com then all the letters
        sent to the email with this domain will reach your server. What does that mean? If someone sends an email to the
        address@example.com email which doesn’t exist the letter is still going to be received by your server as there
        is pointed out @example.com domain name.</p>
      <h2 class="text-thin subtitle">Why Do The Catch-All Email Servers Exist?</h2>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">There are mainly two reasons for catch-all email servers to exist:</p>
      <ul class="text-thin terms-text">
        <li>It is used by companies to ensure that no incoming letter is missed (for example, if the sender made a
          mistake in the email address)
        </li>
        <li>Used by email service providers to detect spammers</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">It is all clear with the first reason, but what about the second one? Well, the
        thing is ESP companies create catch-all email servers and block all the senders that deliver letters to
        unexisting addresses. Just because these addresses do not really belong to any person and cannot be used to
        subscribe on newsletters, so in case someone has sent a letter to such an address he is definitely a
        spammer.</p>
      <h2 class="text-thin subtitle">Types of Catch-All Mailboxes</h2>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">There are two types of catch-all mailboxes:</p>
      <ul class="text-thin terms-text">
        <li>Pure - these are the ones that were created by ESP and have never been used by the real people. Email
          service providers share them on websites that sell email bases to define spammers that use such websites and
          block them.
        </li>
        <li>Recycled - these are the most dangerous catch-all mailboxes since they were once used by real people, but
          were abandoned long time ago. Email Service providers use them to detect spammers.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-thin subtitle">Why Catch-All Domains Are The Problem for You?</h2>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">If you conduct email marketing campaigns, then any catch-all email domain in your
        base becomes a huge problem, even if it is not created by the ESP. Here is the list of reasons why you should
        solve the issues with catch-all emails:</p>
      <ul class="text-thin terms-text">
        <li>They increase the bounce rate that negatively affects your reputation as a sender, ESP`s do not like emails
          that produce letters with a high bounce rate and your email can be blocked for spam.
        </li>
        <li>If you send a letter to the pure catch-all email your domain gets marked as a spammer immediately as ESPs
          know that the only way you could acquire such email address is by using blackhat email marketing methods.
        </li>
        <li>Low opening rate, that is caused by the fact, that no-one really opens email letters that ended up on a
          catch-all email server. A low opening rate negatively affects your reputation and puts your email campaign at
          risk.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="text-thin subtitle">How to Provide Email Verification for Catch-All Email Servers?</h2>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">There is no silver bullet to do this safely. All you can do when dealing with the
        catch-all domains is to get rid of the non-existing or non-actively used emails in your mailing list and build a
        strategy that decreases the risks of getting a spammer marker for your email domain.</p>

      <h2 class="text-thin subtitle">How to Build a Proper Strategy of Dealing with Catch-All Email Servers?</h2>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">There are several steps for you to take if you want to make sure your mailing list
        remains safe for your domain:</p>

      <ul class="text-thin terms-text">
        <li> Use a double opt-in subscription - in a such a way you are guaranteed from making mistakes in email address
          writing and always get real active users in your mailing list.
        </li>
        <li> NEVER purchase or exchange mailing lists from unreliable companies or services.</li>
        <li> Do not send newsletters to the old mailing lists</li>
        <li> Use advanced subscription forms to prevent getting bots in your mailing lists and always check domains of
          the email addresses
        </li>
        <li> Use suppression lists - a list of emails you cannot send emails on.</li>
        <li> Customize soft bounce processing. For example, if per one address you got more than 4 soft bounces then
          delete such address from your mailing list.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="text-thin subtitle">How to Find Catch-All Emails in Your Mailing List?</h2>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Actually, you do not really need to find such emails - your goal is to find emails
        that were created by ESPs to catch spammers and emails that are not really used. First of all, never use the
        mailing lists from the third parties you do not trust. In order to find the emails that harm your sender’s
        reputation you need to:</p>
      <ul class="text-thin terms-text">
        <li>Analyze the bounce rate - if it is abnormally high for the group of emails you acquired in the specified
          period you better get rid of those in your mailing list.
        </li>
        <li>Analyze delivery mistake reports - all the emails that produce delivery mistakes for any reason should
          better be deleted.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="text-thin subtitle">Conclusion</h2>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Catch-all email servers are the big problem for all of those who deal with email
        marketing. Even if you use only the whitehat methods you are not guaranteed from accidentally sending an email
        to the catch-all email server. However, there is no need to panic, just use the recommendations above to build
        the strategy and define broken emails and you are likely to avoid any issues with this problem.</p>
