        According to the recent researches return on investments when promoting goods and services with email marketing
        makes 41:1. This is twice as more than for any other online marketing method.</p>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text no-intent">Marketers mostly know about that. However, not all webmasters know the
        truly useful tips to create an effective email campaign.</p>
      <h3 class="text-thin subtitle">Make Sure Subscriber Is Fond of Getting Your Mails</h3>

        subscribe to your newsletter. This is more the technical moment of leading an email marketing campaign developed
        to improve your deliverability rate, however, it remains important.</p>
      <h3 class="text-thin subtitle">Develop SMART Goals</h3>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Before you launch a email marketing campaign make sure you have specified the
        goals properly. Ask yourself what is the purpose of your campaign. Are you willing to sell the product or
        service, do you want to invite users to the event?</p>

      <h3 class="text-thin subtitle">Personalize Your Letters</h3>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">When you make the newsletter it is always better to make the reader feel like you
        are addressing him as a person, not as a one from the horde of other clients. Thus, you should at least put the
        name of your subscriber to the subject line.</p>

      <h3 class="text-thin subtitle">Do Not Be Irritating</h3>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Apparently, the user in your mailing list has numerous subscriptions along with
        yours, so when he checks his inbox at the end of the day he gets many unread messages. Consider this when you
        create the newsletter - do not send spammy content, do not fail users’ expectations and send them only valuable
        content. Of course, that doesn’t mean you cannot notify them about special offers or important news.</p>
      <h3 class="text-thin subtitle">Choose The Right Time to Send a Letter</h3>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">According to the statistics the most popular days for sending the letters are
        Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. Consider sending your letters another days as user might get too much letters
        on Tue-Thur. Try Monday or Friday. It is better to send the newsletter in evening from 6 to 11 p.m.</p>
      <h3 class="text-thin subtitle">Use Memes, Jokes and Emojis</h3>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">People get more engaged when you cause the positive reactions and using humour is
        the best way to do this.</p>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text no-intent">Just be careful with the formatting. Some of the ESPs are not fond of
        rich media content letters.</p>
      <h3 class="text-thin subtitle">Choose The Conversation Style</h3>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">80% of users stand on the position that the way you talk with them matters so
        conversation style you exploit matters, especially when it comes to the first letters you send. Analyze your
        audience thoroughly and work out your own linguistic formulas that can be applied to your readers and clients.
        However, if you choose informal style still do not use salty language - it disaffects 70% of readers.</p>
      <h3 class="text-thin subtitle">Proofread Your Emails</h3>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">80% of users negatively react on content with poor language and grammar mistakes.
        Make sure you pay attention to style uniformity and formatting of your letter. Never forget about the importance
        of subject line - make it catchy, but do not make it look spammy.</p>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text no-intent">Use paragraphs, headings if necessary, try out different fonts and
        design of the letter.</p>
      <h3 class="text-thin subtitle">Be Attentive to Your Customers’ Needs</h3>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Smart email marketer always finds the way to define the most interesting topics
        for his reader. You can create a poll asking what does the reader want to see i the next digest. React on
        complaints with the apologize letters.</p>
      <h3 class="text-thin subtitle">One Call-to-Action per Letter</h3>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Each letter should have one specified goal, thus there shouldn’t be more than one
        call to action. Make your letters laconic. Reader has to understand in a moment what do you want him to do - buy
        a product, use a new service or order a test-drive.</p>
      <h3 class="text-thin subtitle">Conclusion</h3>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Use these tips to improve your email marketing results. However, note that all
        your content improvement efforts are useless if you send your letters to the wrong email addresses.</p>
