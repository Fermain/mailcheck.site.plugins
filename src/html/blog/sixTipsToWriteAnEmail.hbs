			<p class="article-time">7 min read</p>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text">It is no doubt that electronic mail as a marketing tool has proven its undeniable
				effectiveness. No matter what kind of business you run, if you don’t use email to stay in touch with
				your customers, you are probably losing a good chunk of income that you could be making.</p>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text">However, sending out emails alone with the content irrelevant to your customer needs,
				even if it is on a regular basis, will not do the trick. Making sure your email marketing campaign is
				well-crafted and speaks to your audience must be a priority task to tackle, regardless if you are a
				newly minted entrepreneur or a long-established business.</p>

			<p class="text-thin terms-text">A newsletter is an email sent to inform your readers of your announcements, interesting
			and relevant content and, most importantly, promotions. It is one of the most essential tools in
			keeping your customers in the loop and in gaining traffic to your webpage as well as your social
			media pages.</p>

			<ol class="text-thin terms-text numbered-list">The two fundamental reasons why you need to invest time and efforts into composing your
				newsletter email:
				<li>It will help you retain already existing subscribers and therefore maintain your credibility.</li>
				<li>It could potentially grow your customer database.</li>
			</ol>

			<p class="text-thin text-center text-center-bold">According to Campaign Monitor,
				<a class="text-thin text-thin-link" href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/resources/knowledge-base/what-is-a-good-unsubscribe-rate/">0.17%</a>
				is an average unsubscribe rate. However, if your email
				unsubscribe rates jumps over 2% this signals that
				you need to review your newsletter campaign.</p>

			<p class="text-thin terms-text">So what does it take to create a compelling email that not only helps you grow the number
				of your customers, but also increases your click-through rates and consequently draws income? We
				have assembled <strong>6 tips</strong> on how to write an email that will prompt your subscribers to action.</p>

			<p class="text-thin terms-text"><strong>Send out emails only when you have something to say.</strong> Even though the numbers
				above imposingly tell us to push for email marketing, do not overestimate it. Email is good, but it’s
				even better when combined with other marketing strategies. Consider the social and financial
				situation in the world right now, think what would be relevant to your customers, and try to weave
				that into your newsletter campaign.</p>

			<p class="text-thin terms-text"><strong>Choose one primary call-to-action.</strong> It is acceptable to highlight several things in your
				email. However, do not let those overshadow the main message. Your message could come across
				unclear and customers will lose interest in reading further. Make sure your email has a core point
				and let the rest of the information remain secondary.</p>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text"><strong>Don’t enforce sales content too much.</strong> Clearly, the ultimate goal is to gain customers’
				loyalty and subsequently earn profit. However, stuffing your email with sales content only will come
				off as pushy and somewhat aggressive. After all, making each and every email in your newsletter
				campaign a special offer may get your customers thinking how “special” is your “special offer”.
				Instead, try to balance the content by making it 10% sales and 90% educative.</p>

			<p class="text-thin terms-text"><strong>Invest time into creating an eye-catching subject line.</strong> Believe it or not, subject
				lines are the first step to enticing your subscribers to read more. Your email campaign may be great,
				but if your subject line isn’t - everything can fall through. According to
				<a class="text-thin text-thin-link" href="https://blog.marketo.com/2018/02/email-subject-line-length-works-best.html">Marketo</a>,
				seven words or 41 characters are considered the best size for a subject line. This number yields the highest clicks to open.
				Surprisingly enough, eight words subject line produces half as much as that number.

			</div>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text no-intent">Remember that your emails may be opened on various devices, be it an iPhone or a MacBook, so you
				might want to consider making your subject line even shorter. As sad as it may sound, people don’t
				have time to read lengthy texts, so try to keep your subject line short, striking and to the point.
			</p>

			<p class="text-thin terms-text"><strong>Invest into design.</strong> According to
				<a class="text-thin text-thin-link" href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/34061/How-to-Make-Sure-Your-Website-Passes-the-Dreaded-Blink-Test.aspx">HubSpot</a>,
				an average user spends between 3 to 5
				seconds skimming a website. We can easily assume that these metrics can be applied to a newsletter
				too. This means your email has to grab your customer’s attention, get your message across and awake
				your customer’s interest, all in 3 to 5 seconds. Sounds like a challenge? Remember, that if the layout
				of your email newsletter is too heavy on media and is cheaply designed, you may not get the desired
				results. Make sure your newsletter has some blank white spaces. This will alleviate overall outlook
				of your email and make it easier for your subscribers to click the right button. If you are struggling
				with designing your newsletter layout, hire a professional designer, or use an app. There’s plenty of
				beginner-friendly applications that allow to create stunning layouts.
			</p>

			<p class="text-thin terms-text"><strong>Keep it short and concise.</strong> We know no people who would want to read a 500-words
				email, especially in the times, when everything in life evolves with lightning speed. Making sure your
				email includes only relevant, crucial information, that prompts your subscriber to click and find out
				more is the key in successful email newsletter.
			</p>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text">And one last but not least tip, even though contradictory in its nature to the entire idea of
				email newsletter, don’t forget to add an Unsubscribe button. As sad as it may sound, your customers
				must be given a freedom to unsubscribe. After all, nothing is perfect, but those “Unsubscribe me”
				requests are actually an alarm for you to improve.</p>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Clearly, preparing a decent newsletter campaign is a chunk of work, but in fact it is only a
				drop in the ocean in the entire email marketing campaign. Making sure those honed to the perfection
				emails reach real people and hopefully make them your loyal customers is something you should
				consider next.

				our email validation tool, uses state-of-the-art algorithms to conclude
				whether the emails in your database belong to real people, so that all that time and efforts spent on

				can now sift through thousands of emails in no time. It offers an API integration that

      <p class="text-thin terms-text">We learn as we go, and the above list is probably exhaustless. Perfecting your email
				newsletter campaign is a process that involves constant changes, and the best way to ensure that
				your changes are actually improvements is to test them.</p>
