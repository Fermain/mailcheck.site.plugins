      <h2 class="title">Email Marketing Campaign Metrics for Small Business</h2>


      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Email marketing metrics are used to analyze efficiency of the marketing
        campaign.There can be different tasks and goals for an email marketing campaign launched by a small business -
        the number of registrations, purchases, opening rate etc. For each of the task and goal we make a separate
        metric. Email marketer has to consider these metrics and monitor them for decision-making purposes.</p>
      <h3 class="text-thin subtitle">Metrics in Plain Words</h3>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">In this article we are going to disclose internal metrics - these metrics show
        what happens with our letters from the moment of sending and to the moment of getting on site or app - usually
        it is about users engagement and quality of newsletter. There are also external metrics that show what happens
        before and after the newsletter was sent - the number of new users attracted, the income of the company from one
        letter, etc.</p>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text no-intent">Metrics can be represented in absolute and relative indicators.
        Absolute indicators are written in figures, for example, the number of people that have opened the letter, the
        number of clicks due to CTA etc. Relative indicators are showing the coefficient that is derived from the
        absolute figures. For example, if there are 10 clicks from 100 letters it is an absolute figure, however, if you
        write 0.1 click rate it is a relative figure.</p>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text no-intent">You both need to consider absolute and relative figures as both kinds
        of figures are meaningful and can be used for analysis.</p>
      <h3 class="text-thin subtitle">Open Rate</h3>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Open rate is a relative figure showing the coefficient of the opened/sent
        letters. In this metrics there only counts the quantity of HTML-letter openings with the loaded images. In case
        your subscriber opens the letter in the plain text format, the opening won’t be counted. ESP doesn’t transit
        information about the opening rate, it is done by a pixel - an invisible image loaded with all other visible
        images in the letter.</p>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text no-intent">In case the HTML-letter is opened by the subscriber more than one time
        there will be counted each opening.</p>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text no-intent">Normal opening rate can vary depending on the type of business and
        letters. However,opening rate is not the most accurate metrics as you do not know how many users watched your
        letter in the plain text mode.</p>

           alt="Email Marketing Campaign Metrics for Small Business">
      <h3 class="text-thin subtitle">CTR</h3>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">This metrics shows the share of subscribers that have clicked one of the links in
        your letter - it also could be a button or image. When the click rate is counted all clicks are considered.
      </p>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text no-intent">When click rate is calculated you can define the number of clicks for
        the specified link or for the all links. In order to count click rate the links in ESP are replaced by redirect
        links. ESP is fixing the transition and takes user to the original address. Despite from the open rate click
        rate can be calculated accurately.
      </p>
      <h3 class="text-thin subtitle">Unsubscribe Rate</h3>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">The maximum unsubscribe rate shouldn’t excess 0,5-2%. However, it all depends on
        the industry. <a class="text-thin text-thin-link"
                         href="https://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?htmlfid=UVL12406USEN">According to the
          research</a> the optimal average unsubscribe rate for consumer goods industry makes
        0,208%, while for the non-commerce organizations it is 0,058%.
      </p>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text no-intent">Unsubscribe rate is calculated based on the delivered letters figures
        as some of the ESPs allows users to unsubscribe without opening the letter (like Gmail).
      </p>
      <h3 class="text-thin subtitle">Main Reasons for The High Unsubscribe Rate:</h3>
      <ul class="text-thin terms-text">
        <li>Poorly collected, purchased or exchanged mailing list that contains of users that did not make a clear
          choice of being subscribed to your newsletter.
        </li>
        <li>Newsletters are similar for all of the users, there was no segmentation done.</li>
        <li>Many old subscribers that do not really interested in getting newsletter anymore. Read about the
          consequences of having such addresses in your mailing list in our article.
        </li>
        <li>Irrelevant content - company doesn’t know what do its client want to get in newsletter</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="text-thin subtitle">How to Decrease Unsubscribe Rate:</h3>
      <ul class="text-thin terms-text">
        <li>Make sure you clean the mailing list from the inactive users. Email verification services can help with this
          task.
        </li>
        <li>Do not use purchased or rented mailing lists and parced lists.</li>
        <li>Enforce double opt-in subscription.</li>
        <li>Create interesting content for all subscriber groups.</li>
        <li>Study up the clients’ preferences using the content map. Read about this in our article about the valuable
          tip for small business email marketing.
        </li>
        <li>Test headings, content, design of your letters on small groups of clients before you send the newsletter to
          all users.
        </li>
        <li>Define the best time for newsletter; make tests to find out how often can you make the newsletter, which
          time is it better to open the letters.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="text-thin subtitle">Complaint Rate</h3>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">When subscriber marks the letter as a smap an ESP and provider consider that when
        defining sender’s reputation. Often that doesn’t mean you are a spammer, it is just about the subscribers do not
        want to get your letters anymore so they have marked you as a spammer. In order to avoid that make
        unsubscription as easy as possible.</p>

           alt="Email Marketing Campaign Metrics for Small Business">
      <h3 class="text-thin subtitle">Churn rate</h3>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Business must widen its contact base on the permanent basis. You will reach this
        goal if you constantly improve your email marketing campaign for business and ensure that there are more users
        subscribed than unsubscribed.</p>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text no-intent"> Churn rate shows the share of users that have unsubscribed for a given
        period. For example, if among the 1000 subscribers 150 have unsubscribed during the year the churn rate makes
        15%.</p>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text no-intent">Depending on the business industry you can either make calculations on
        the annual or monthly basis. It is okay for most of the companies to have 5% churn rate annually, while 5%
        monthly something is going wrong.</p>
      <h3 class="text-thin subtitle">Conclusion</h3>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">If you think there are too much efforts you need to bring to calculate the
        metrics, note that email marketing is one of the most efficient ways to promote your product or company which is
        grounded in our article.</p>
