      <h1 class="title">How to Personalize Your Newsletter and Increase Sales?</h1>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Successful email marketing strategy development considers you know about your
        clients much more than just their email address. You also need to be aware of their tastes and expectations.
        That is the only way to make them loyal to your brand. In this article we are going to disclose useful tips that
        can help you personalize newsletter and make it engaging for your clients.</p>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text no-intent">Personalization is important as template letters do not sell well, they
        even barely get read. In order to make an efficient personalized newsletter you need to address client by name,
        consider his current location and offer the products he needs here and now.</p>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text no-intent">Personalized emails should contain relevant information for the
        subscriber. You can set personalized data in the letter using tags.</p>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text no-intent">So what do you need to do to start using email marketing personalization
        techniques? The answer is obvious: you need to gather data about your clients and make relevant letters.</p>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text no-intent">According to Experian research 69% of users are willing to provide
        personal data if it is going to be used to make service better for them. However, in practice the more there are
        fields in the subscription form (especially the mandatory ones), the smaller is the number of users that fill
        it.</p>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text no-intent">So how can you collect information about clients and use it for you good
        afterwards? Modern statistical tools allow you to gather all the necessary data while advanced email marketing
        services allow you to segmentate and interpret them. Using combination of these tools allows you to
        significantly improve quality of your newsletter personalization.</p>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text no-intent">Let’s see which user data you can acquire using analytical tools and how
        to exploit this data.</p>
      <h2 class="text-thin subtitle">Behaviour-Based Personalization</h2>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">This is one of the most efficient ways of personalization in marketing. After you
        study the pages someone has visited, the time he sent on the website, how many sections he has looked through,
        whether he has used the search and what he was searching for, you can develop an efficient personalized letter.
      </p>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text no-intent">Imagine that client has spent a long time choosing the bicycle and even
        bought one. After the purchase he has visited a category page with accessories and left the website. In case he
        gets an email with the list of helmets and locks for the bike he is likely to buy something.
      <p class="text-thin terms-text no-intent">Most of the email marketers use Google Analytics tool to study behaviour
        of their clients.</p>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text no-intent">So you need to find out:</p>
      <ul class="text-thin terms-text">
        <li>How long did the client’s session on your website lasted?</li>
        <li>How many pages did he look through?</li>
        <li>What did he buy?</li>
        <li>What is the share of new visitors?</li>
        <li>What is the bounce rate?</li>
        <li>How much did you earn on each single client who has came from the mailing?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="text-thin subtitle">ROI Calculation</h2>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">ROIis an indicator you can use to define the efficiency of your newsletter in
        scope of income/expenditures. In order to get a proper coefficient one has to consider sales data from each
        letter sent.</p>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text no-intent">Based on ROI you can estimate efficiency of different types of
        newsletters. In case ROI is less than 1 the campaign is recognized failed. However, if you do everything right
        you are likely to get a much better result.</p>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text no-intent"> You can consider newsletter to be successful if the ROI is 2 or more.
        This indicator is a good decision-making tool allowing you to make financially grounded changes to your email
        marketing strategy.</p>

      <h2 class="text-thin subtitle">Click and Opening Based Personalization</h2>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Click statistics shows the followed links and the number of clicks made by your
        subscribers. This allows to estimate clients’ activity and figure out their needs. For example, if you have sent
        newsletter to the women under 30 and there were 2 links in it (one leading to the category with family goods and
        another to the beauty products) you will find out what interests them the most from the click statistics.</p>
      <h2 class="text-thin subtitle">Click Heat Map</h2>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Click heat map helps you to analyze statistics on page scrolling. It looks like a
        weather map, however, instead of the highest and lowest temperature you see the colour marking for the clicks
        distribution.</p>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text no-intent"> This technology allows email marketer to define which elements of the
        mailing have attracted subscribers the most.</p>
      <h2 class="text-thin subtitle">Opening Statistics</h2>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Opening statistics also helps personalizing newsletters. Each time you send
        letters to your clients it is vital to know whether they open letters or not. If not, that means the subject
        line is not catchy enough. In such a case you need to analyze the statistics and personalize a letter for the
        customer.</p>
      <h2 class="text-thin subtitle">Personalization by Device</h2>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">You also should consider making personalization by device used. Monitoring the
        gadgets used by customers to read your letters can be a good way to make a more personalized offer and
        segmentate customers by device - for example, Android and Apple users.</p>
      <h2 class="text-thin subtitle">Conclusion</h2>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Personalization demands vast efforts you, however, if done properly it can
        increase your conversion dramatically.</p>
