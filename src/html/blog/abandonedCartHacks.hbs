      <h2 class="text-thin subtitle">Use a Progress Indicator</h2>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Everything these days is developing too dynamically. Customers are used to instant
        decisions, so they don’t like having to click through hundreds of pages to get to the finish line. You think
        that you’re done and yet another window opens up. It’s annoying and repels.</p>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text no-intent">There is a good decision for that, just use a progress indicator at the
        top of the page. Then visitors will know exactly where they are at the moment.</p>

      <h2 class="text-thin subtitle">Include Small Pictures of Each Cart Item on Checkout Pages</h2>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Planning your strategy to get the consumer all the way through
        completion of the order, you need to keep their passion during this process. When customers are acting off of
        impulse, this aspect really pays off. You have already worked on your marketing, your website design, so
        customers saw your product and added it to their cart.</p>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text no-intent">Make sure all pictures are visible on your checkout page. In this way
        you’ll remind consumers of what they can get right now. This can be called one of the varieties of drip
        marketing.</p>

      <h2 class="text-thin subtitle">Don’t Forget About The Navigation Between Cart and Shopping Linear</h2>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">If you every tried shopping online, you’ve surely gone back and forth between
        looking at catalog and checking your cart. It doesn’t work if you have to go find your product of choice again
        if everything has to reload. Your website should be as simple as possible. Customize seamless navigation.</p>

      <h2 class="text-thin subtitle">Provide Several Payment Options</h2>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Since you’re trying to earn money, it’s probably best to provide your customers
        with several ways to pay for their product. Choice is always an advantage. Surely you need the customary Visa
        and MasterCard options, but try to branch out of them. Consider adding Google Pay, PayPal, etc. Even
        cryptocurrency would be good. And don’t forget to provide them an easy way to log into these platforms. Loosing
        their place can be annoying as well.</p>

      <h2 class="text-thin subtitle">Call to Actions are must</h2>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">CTA are something we are familiar with when it comes to using email account
        validation tool and writing effective sales copy. But it is always left out of checkout pages and carts. It’s
        easy to explain. A lot of website owners think that an item in the cart means the deal is closed. This is not
        the case at all.</p>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text no-intent">Short and simple Call to Actions will work just fine. Brevity is the
        soul of wit. It works as good as email validation verification services do.</p>

      <h2 class="text-thin subtitle">Make Cart-Saving Simple & Easy</h2>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">There is nothing worse about online shopping than spending time choosing the
        products, having to leave the laptop or to close phone, only to later come back and see that your shopping cart
        has been emptied and you need to start again. There are a lot of ways to save a situation. You can provide an
        appropriate button that does it, or you can use cookies with a prompt to let customers know why this feature is
        needed.</p>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text no-intent">You can also use top email validation services and after that send your
        consumers follow-up with different subject lines, e.g. “There’s something in your cart…”. Your customers need to
        know they can just click a link and return to checkout.</p>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text no-intent">One note on timing: It is advisable not to wait too long before you send
        them out. Some marketers prefer to send an email instantly after a cart is abandoned. Use email bounce checker
        and reach a wider audience.</p>

      <h2 class="text-thin subtitle">Don’t Require a Login to Check Out</h2>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Recalling the annoying aspects of online shopping, another cart killer is
        requiring someone to sign up to log in to make a purchase. It is a waste of time. Just imagine — you’ve spent a
        lot of time choosing and now you need to register, check your e-mailbox, come back again and so on and so
        forth.</p>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text no-intent">Always provide a guest checkout. You can ask for the consumer’s email at
        the end, because you still need it for direct or drip marketing later. And use some kind of web service to
        validate email address.</p>

      <h2 class="text-thin subtitle">Be Aware About All Aspects of Delivering</h2>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">One more infamous cart killer is the unexpected shipping charges. Your cart is
        ready, you’re going to check out and find that your purchase is going to be $15 more and you’ll have to wait
        about two weeks for the shipment. You will definitely lose your sale.</p>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text no-intent">Always include all such costs upfront in the cart and make sure you
        offer the convenient delivery with specific delivery estimates. This is no less important than the best free
        email verifier.</p>

      <h2 class="text-thin subtitle">Reduce Page Load Times</h2>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">It doesn't matter how good your site is if your page is taking too much time to
        load. Your customers don’t want to wait and they will end up avoiding such a nice experience. You can ask tech
        geeks to help you out with this task as well as install software to verify email addresses.</p>

      <h2 class="text-thin subtitle">Set Up Auto Email Responders for Abandoned Carts</h2>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">If you want to provide more intensive, offer a discount for carts and remind you
        customers that it can expire soon. You can verify emails addresses and send this message to specific people.
        Using the best bulk email verifier is key to keeping your database actual. Or you can set your site up with
        triggers, pop-up messages.</p>

      <h2 class="text-thin subtitle">Conclusion</h2>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Despite all your effort, abandoned carts will still happen. Nothing personal, just
        stats. It will always be an issue for any e-commerce website. A multi-pronged approach will mitigate it and
        undoubtedly boost your sales in the long run. Good luck!</p>
