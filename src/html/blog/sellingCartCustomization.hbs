      <h2 class="title">X Tips on Customization of Selling Cart</h2>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Cart in the online store is an interface which user can use to add products he is
        ought to purchase.</p>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text no-intent">A simple example: when you shop around the mall you have a cart with you
        to put there products you are going to buy. You can pay for them in the cashier zone and afterward take them
        home. The carts in online stores are almost the same.</p>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text no-intent">Sometimes buyer visits the online store and leaves without buying a
        thing. Usually, we can see that he has abandoned full cart before leaving. One of the reasons for this to happen
        is poor design and concept of the cart.</p>
      <h3 class="text-thin subtitle">How to Design the Cart in Your Online Store?</h3>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">In order to motivate a client to make a purchase you need to make it display in a
        common way for the client:</p>
      <ul class="text-thin terms-text">
        <li>The cart should be placed on the top right corner.</li>
        <li>The icon should be intuitive - it should look like a cart or bag</li>
        <li>The icon shouldn’t look like a banner - such images get filtered and disaffect the customer</li>
        <li>Near the cart icon, there should be a list of the products put there with their prices and the overall sum
        </li>
        <li>If there is even one product in the cart then its icon should display that, notifying the customer that cart
          is not empty anymore.
        </li>
      </ul>

           alt="X Tips on Customization of Selling Cart">
      <h3 class="text-thin subtitle">Cart Mechanism - Basic Functions</h3>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">After the customer has chosen products to put in the cart he has to be redirected
        to the checkout page to create an order:</p>
      <ul class="text-thin terms-text">
        <li>The image of the cart icon on the page should be intuitive - use three options: a basket, a cart or a bag.
          Do not be original here and do not use the thumb up or any other icon.
        </li>
        <li>Icon has to be available on all the site pages and be placed on the same spot all the time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Inside the cart:</p>
      <ul class="text-thin terms-text">
        <li>A customer should have an opportunity to process his orders on the cart page.</li>
        <li>There should be a table with prices of each product separately and the whole sum.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text no-intent">In case the store accepts online coupons the visitor should be able to
        enter the coupon code and see the product price with discounts.</p>
      <h3 class="text-thin subtitle">How to Use The Cart on 100%</h3>
      <ul class="text-thin terms-text">
        <li>Make a call-to-action to purchase the product</li>
        <li>The button near the product should call the action. Type in the word Order Now or Buy.</li>
        <li>If the button doesn’t contain any text it should be notable, large and have the clear icon</li>
        <li>The Buy button should be placed on all the site pages with the product on the blocks with a short
          description.
        </li>
        <li>If someone tries to buy a product that already is in the cart there should be a notification about it.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="text-thin subtitle">Order Management</h3>
      <ul class="text-thin terms-text">
        <li>Customer shouldn’t get confused when he enters the cart page. For example, if he wants to purchase a second
          item of the same product there should be + and - buttons for that around the quantity raw.
        </li>
        <li>Customer should always be able to immediately get back to the store - the return button should be visible
          and bright
        </li>
        <li>Point out the shipping cost on the cart page</li>
        <li>After completing the order customer should see ‘thank you’ page.</li>
      </ul>

           height="374" alt="X Tips on Customization of Selling Cart">
      <h3 class="text-thin subtitle">Additional Options</h3>
      <ul class="text-thin terms-text">
        <li>Set up a widget displaying supplementary products</li>
        <li>Make sure that the history of actions in the cart is recorded - if the customer did not make a purchase
          yesterday, make sure the items he has put in the cart are available today
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="text-thin subtitle">Filling Form with Data</h3>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Forms with many fields negatively affect the chance for the purchase to be
        finished. If you create a form with 20 fields to be filled, implement hard captcha, email password verification
        - each such stage demotivates the customer to complete the purchase. There are many other online stores on the
        Internet, so keep that in mind when developing forms or any other obstacles to finishing the purchase in one
        click.</p>
      <h3 class="text-thin subtitle">Follow the Minimum Field Approach</h3>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Do not abuse pop-down menus - sometimes it is better to let the user type in data
        on his own. For example, when one has to type in the birth date or the city.</p>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text no-intent">Do not force people to subscribe to your newsletter. This can decrease
        your deliverability rate as a sender and spoil your reputation in the eyes of the client.</p>
      <h3 class="text-thin subtitle">Subscription to Newsletter</h3>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">We all want to get more data about our clients and get him subscribed on our
        newsletter. Then the data we get can be used to create personalized offers for our clients. Unfortunately, some
        of the online stores get users subscribed automatically. Moreover, they do not leave the link to unsubscribe
        from the mailing. That is a wrong approach. Always get explicit confirmation from users you want to
        subscribe.</p>
      <h3 class="text-thin subtitle">Purchase Stages in the Online Store</h3>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">There should be three stages of purchase enforced on the website:</p>
      <ul class="text-thin terms-text">
        <li>Simple - user enters email or mobile phone number and then gets in touch with the manager. If instead, you
          can provide a one-click purchase service it should be an intuitive and primitive process.
        </li>
        <li>New user - after the user clicks registration button he only should enter his name, email, phone number,
          payment method, and delivery address.
        </li>
        <li>Signed up user - user enters his login data and all his data is entered in order form automatically.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text no-intent">If the user has to wait more than several seconds for the manager’s
        response, he estimates this like disrespect to him and his time. Thus, you need to provide an immediate
        notification about the pending order, so that manager would be able to contact the client ASAP.</p>
