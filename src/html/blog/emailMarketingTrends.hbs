            <h1 class="title">Email Marketing Trends 2019 for Small Business</h1>
            <p class="text-thin terms-text">Email marketing trends in 2019 have changed dramatically. However, some
                things remain unchanged. It is still important to provide high-quality content as users deal with a huge
                amount of content on a daily basis. One more thing that remains unchanged is the fact that the ROI of
                email marketing remains outstanding, and it is still the most efficient way to communicate with your
                clients online. Although we see that the approach to email marketing for small business has changed a
                little bit in 2019.</p>
            <p class="text-thin terms-text no-intent">In the article we are going to disclose the trends that will take
                over in 2019. We also are going to define the techniques that do not work anymore. Get rid of them in
                future so that you can get more trust and reputability from your subscribers.</p>
            <h2 class="text-thin subtitle">Full Newsletter Automation</h2>
            <p class="text-thin terms-text">It usually takes too much time from email marketers to prepare the
                newsletter. It also happens that email marketing campaigns are being held not regularly but
                occasionally. Automate the process using the newsletter service and you are going to cut your working
                hours dramatically.</p>
            <p class="text-thin terms-text no-intent">Email marketing automation helps you to adopt your campaign under
                the needs and tastes of your subscribers and thus improve the quality of your newsletter. It is going to
                be much easier to hold an analysis of the information taken and make good decisions. It allows companies
                to customize the content for each of us considering one’s preferences. This is going to lead to increase
                of open rate, click rate and conversion rate.</p>
            <p class="text-thin terms-text no-intent">Preparation of newsletters stops looking like a disaster and can
                turn into an easy task. For example, there should a series of welcome letters that is being created only
                once and then is launched automatically. Such an approach forms trust of the users and provides loyalty
                to your brand. You do not need to memorize the content strategy or which letter has to be sent next as
                everything is automated. It is very important for you as it all depends on the beginning of your
                conversation.</p>
            <p class="text-thin terms-text no-intent">Mailing services have powerful tools to segmentate and personalize
                newsletters. Using those you can send clients content based on the analysis of their previous actions -
                you look what they've opened, links they have pressed, etc. Thus, without automation it is going to be
                hard for you to compete with other companies and keep your mailing on high level.</p>

                 alt="Email Marketing Trends 2019 for Small Business">
            <h2 class="text-thin subtitle">Deep Segmentation and Personalization</h2>
            <p class="text-thin terms-text">It always has been a good idea to conduct deep segmentation and
                personalization for your newsletter. However, it is more than a good idea - it is also possible thanks
                to the majority of the online tools provided by the email marketing automation tools. We have reviewed
                personalization in details in <a class="text-thin text-thin-link" href="/personalizeYourNewsletter">our
                    previous article</a>. Still here we will disclose the basic points to consider.</p>
            <ul class="text-thin terms-text">
                <li>personalization can only be successful if you analyse the behaviour and preferences of your users
                </li>
                <li>you also need to consider basic metrics like geo, sex, and age</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-thin terms-text no-intent">For example, the Stitch Fix company has figured a good way to
                increase the open rate and engage users - they are publishing a short test to define the client’s
                opinion on the future fashion trends. Thus, clients are engaged and afterwards they get the relevant
                content.</p>
            <h2 class="text-thin subtitle">Enforced Spam Control</h2>
            <p class="text-thin terms-text">The more time is passing the more it takes from the content creators to
                think over their strategies and approaches to content. Today the newsletters are much more valuable than
                the days before when we got tons of irrelevant content even from the good companies which just did not
                know how to make us engaged.</p>
            <p class="text-thin terms-text no-intent">For now you need to bring even more efforts to get rid of spam in
                your mailings.</p>
            <p class="text-thin terms-text no-intent">Email marketers already know that it is a bad idea to subscribe on
                a mailing someone who is not willing to as there are high chances the email will go the spam box which
                has a negative effect on <a class="text-thin text-thin-link" href="/sendersReputation">the
                    sender’s reputation</a>. Thus, you need to make sure the user has made a clear
                confirm on subscription and profile the content you send to make it remain relevant and engaging.</p>
            <img class="article-image" src="../../assets/img/email-marketing-trends-img-2.jpg" width="500" height="281"
                 alt="Email Marketing Trends 2019 for Small Business">
            <h2 class="text-thin subtitle">Interaction and Gamification</h2>
            <p class="text-thin terms-text">Gamification is a fresh trend that can bring you outstanding results.
                Instead of the standard letters with the text content you can do something more, something that is not
                really spread out among the email marketers but surely will become soon - make your letters interactive
                and implement a couple of gamification features. Animation, games, and quizzes should become the part of
                your content marketing strategy.</p>
            <p class="text-thin terms-text no-intent">Thus, in 2019 you need to use interactive elements in your
                mailings. This will lead to the increase in sales and attraction of new clients. This is also going to
                improve the acceptance of the emails among clients. However, the main key to success is to be moderate
                and use all the new features available in the right way.</p>
            <p class="text-thin terms-text no-intent">If you start to include in each letter the excessive amount of
                media content it is going to be too much for the user and you are going to get negative effect. The
                thing is that after couple of such letters the user will become either tired of your emails or irritated
                by overloaded newsletter. It is better to make them a part of the content strategy, not its core.</p>
