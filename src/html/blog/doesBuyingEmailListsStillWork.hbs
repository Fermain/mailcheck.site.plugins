      <h1 class="title">Does buying email lists still work?</h1>
			<p class="article-time">8 min read</p>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text">An email list is a list of subscribers, who may or may not opted-in to receive emails from
        a certain sender.</p>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text">The first thing email marketers will hear from list providers is that email lists could save
        them time growing their email database. Technically, that is correct. However, there is no such
        thing as a free lunch. Buying email lists does have hidden drawbacks. Read on if you want to
        know what they are.</p>

      <div class="article-image-container">
        <img class="article-image" src="../../assets/img/appInstitute.jpg" alt="AppInstitute">

      </div>

			<p class="text-thin terms-text">Email lists may contain emails of users who never subscribed to your newsletter,
        therefore chances are they will not open your emails and will not engage with it. Email lists also
        contain old emails that can no longer be active, which will result in the increase of your bounce
        rate. Even if a company that is selling you email lists claims (and it certainly will) it contains
        only high-quality data, chances are that data is irrelevant to your business, meaning that
        recipients will not be interested in the content of your emails, which will be followed by an
        increased unsubscribe rate.</p>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Using email lists could also lead to some serious legal implications. Email marketers
        could easily use email lists in the past if they wanted to. However, after the
        <a class="text-thin text-thin-link" href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">General Data Protection Regulation</a>
        (GDPR, the European data privacy act) was passed in May 2018, the use
        of email lists was forbidden. According to the GDPR, not only your subscribers have to have an
        option to unsubscribe, but they must also have the right to opt-in to receive any emails from
        you. Having introduced the GDPR, Europe wanted to protect its users from receiving unwanted
        emails completely eradicating the use of email lists. So if you are planning on targeting users
        from Europe, you might want to forget about buying email lists, unless you do not fear the legal
        consequences this may bring.
       </p>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text">When it comes to your reputation, email deliverability and user engagement is what
        defines it. Deliverability rate is measured by the number of emails that landed in your
        subscribers' inbox, as opposed to their spam folder. In this regard, email lists could be a pitfall
        on the way to successful email marketing. Whether you want it or not, the majority of purchased
        lists will contain old email addresses that aren’t active, which will result in your emails being
        bounced and your bounce rate climb.
        <a class="text-thin text-thin-link" href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/email-marketing/2019/05/making-sense-email-bounce-rates/">A bounce rate of no higher than 2% is normal.</a>
        If a recipient does receive an email from a sender they never subscribed to, expect that this recipient
        will most likely not engage with it. In the worst-case scenario, they will mark it as spam. These
        two at first sight insignificant factors in fact measure your business reputation, and jeopardizing
        it and neglecting all the efforts put into creating an email campaign would be irrational.</p>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Sending emails to recipients who have little or if any interest in your content, can cause
        no less troubles than high bounce rates. Internet Service Providers (ISP) like Gmail, Hotmail, or
        Yahoo want to make sure their users receive relevant and high-quality content from email
        marketers. They track if their users open, engage with or report an email as spam. If there is
        high engagement, the ISP will automatically make sure similar emails will arrive at the
        recipient’s inbox. If there is low engagement, the ISP will make sure the email skips the
        recipient’s inbox and will land in their spam folder. The more sender’s emails are marked as
        spam or are bounced, the lower email deliverability rates will be, which will in turn damage the
        sender’s reputation and have his emails constantly marked as spam, even if the recipient didn’t
        mark them so.
      </p>

      </div>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text">As you have already understood, email deliverability and engagement rate are the two
        factors that affect your sender score, and Internet Service Providers are the ones who determine
        that score. A number of things, such as spam complaints, mailing to inactive email addresses,
        email blacklists, the number of emails rejected and accepted by users, influence your sender
        score. Since low engagement is the first thing you will get from purchased email lists, you will
        most certainly see a significant sender score drop.

			<p class="text-thin terms-text">We have established that buying email lists is bad. But how to fill up an email database
        fast and with quality subscribers? As disappointing as it may sound, building an organic email
        list takes time and effort. In the end, your ultimate goal is to have your subscribers open and
        read your emails and ultimately become your loyal customers. That does take time and hard
        work, but the benefits of it your business will enjoy are definitely worth it.
			</p>

      <p class="text-thin terms-text">While we recommend against buying email lists, you are probably still thinking about
        giving it a try just for the sake of curiosity, or because you need people who you can email and
        you need them fast. However, don’t jump the gun with sending your newsletter to your “fresh
        new subscribers” just yet. You might want to consider filtering it through an email validation
        software, like <a class="text-thin text-thin-link" href="https://www.mailcheck.co/#features">Mailcheck</a>.
        Validating your email lists, purchased or organic, will make sure your email database is clean and contains only valid email addresses,
        which in turn will improve your deliverability and engagement rates, as well as your reputation, and will turn your subscribers
        into loyal customers.
