        may include social network profiles not set to ‘private’ or information on a social networking page visible to
        users who are not logged in. If you do not want to be searched or indexed by search engines or services like
        Mailcheck, we recommend that you set appropriate privacy controls within social networks and third-party
        applications such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. You can learn how to do this by visiting these sites
        directly.</p>

        logins or to monitor web traffic routing to our Website and aggregate usage of the Services. You may turn off
        cookies that have been placed on your computer by following the instructions for your browser. Please be aware

      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Mailcheck and its Services contain links to other websites. If you choose to click
        on these third-party links, you will be directed to that third party’s website. The fact that we link to a
        website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of affiliation, nor is it an endorsement of a
        third party’s privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party
        websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or
        solicit personal information from you. Other websites and services follow different rules regarding the use or
        disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or
        statements of the other websites you visit.</p>

      <h2 class="text-thin subtitle">Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information</h2>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">We may share aggregated information that includes non-identifying information,
        Publicly Identifiable Information and information derived from the use of third-party tracking technologies with
        third parties for analysis and profiling. Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain
        your Personally Identifiable Information.</p>

      <h2 class="text-thin subtitle">Service Providers</h2>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate the Services, to
        provide the Services on our behalf, to perform services related to administration of the Services (including,
        without limitation, bill and credit card payment processing, chat support, maintenance, hosting and database
        management services, Site and Services support, web analytics and administration). These third parties may have
        access to your Personally Identifiable Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated
        not to disclose or use it for any other purpose. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the
        provisions in this Policy regarding notification.</p>

      <h2 class="text-thin subtitle">Your Email Lists</h2>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">When you upload an email list, whether manually or via one of our Partner
        services, Mailcheck has access to information in your list, including but not limited to email addresses, IP
        addresses, and/or first and last names, for the purpose of delivering verification results related to this
        data.</p>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Your subscriber lists are stored on secure Mailcheck servers. We have not, nor
        will we ever, under any circumstances, contact people on your lists, market to people on your lists, or sell,
        steal, rent, or share your lists with any other party, except if required by law. Only authorized employees have
        access to view your lists.</p>

      <h2 class="text-thin subtitle">Safeguarding Your Information</h2>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">We use encryption, access controls, and data security policies to protect your
        passwords, credit card numbers and email lists. When you enter sensitive information (such as login credentials
        or credit card information) we encrypt the transmission of that information using Secure Socket Layer technology
        (SSL). Your Credit Card Data is protected using controls compliant with Payment Card Industry (or PCI) security
        standards.</p>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect sensitive
        information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. With this in mind, you must keep access to your account
        secure and undisclosed. Mailcheck does not store plaintext passwords, and cannot see yours. We cannot send a
        forgotten password, but we will reset it and notify you of the change to your account.</p>

      <h2 class="text-thin subtitle">Notice of Security Breach</h2>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Should an unauthorized intrusion to our system occur which affects you or people
        on your Email Lists, Mailcheck will notify you as soon as reasonably possible, consistent with the legitimate
        needs of law enforcement or with any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the
        reasonable integrity, security, and confidentiality of the Service and your data. The Customer will be notified
        with documentation of such an event and the actions we took in response.</p>

      <h2 class="text-thin subtitle">GDPR</h2>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Our primary goal from the beginning has always been to not only offer the highest
        quality verification processes but also assure you that your data is always securely protected in the process.
        Mailcheck complies with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which is designed to protect data and privacy
        for all individuals in the European Union. Mailcheck is fully in compliance with GDPR and strives to always
        provide you with the ease of knowing your data is strictly secured in our highly secured encrypted servers.</p>

      <h2 class="text-thin subtitle">Accuracy</h2>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Mailcheck takes pride in delivering information that is accurate to the best of
        our knowledge. The Customer is responsible for keeping both their personal data and email list data accurate and
        up to date. Any changes to the Customer’s Personally Identifiable Information should be promptly updated by the
        Customer through their account profile on the Website or by notifying Mailcheck. Changes to the Customer’s email
        list data should be promptly updated by the Customer through their own means.</p>

      <h2 class="text-thin subtitle">Retention</h2>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Mailcheck will retain and use Personal Identifiable Information for as long as
        necessary to comply with our financial and legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Mailcheck will retain email list data processed on behalf of our Customers for as
        long as reasonably required to provide the Services under which we were initially provided this information,
        subject to this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Service. The Customer has 30 days to download data results
        provided as a result of use of the Service, after which this data may no longer be available for download.</p>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Mailcheck may also keep some non-personally identifiable data indefinitely,
        relating to when and where emails were sent, which bounced, which resulted in a complaint, and similar
        information, for reasons explained in this policy.</p>

      <h2 class="text-thin subtitle">Enforcement</h2>
      <p class="text-thin terms-text">Mailcheck cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private
        parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law
        enforcement officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and
        legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Mailcheck or a
        third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop any activity we may
        consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical, inappropriate or legally actionable.</p>
